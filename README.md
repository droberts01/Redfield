# Redfield
Portable time-dependent Redfield solver for high-performance simulations of QAA

Calculation of transition rates suggests that incoherent tunneling accelerates at bottlenecks of QAA, thermalizing these bottlenecks in an intermediate-N regime, and dominating coherent (quantum) tunneling in the large-N limit - a computational advantage. This Redfield solver spearheads an ongoing search for experimental signatures of this new phenomenon in the D Wave 2X at NASA Ames.
