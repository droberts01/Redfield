# Redfield
Time-dependent Redfield solver for simulating D Wave physics

Project Status: Active (Summer 2016 - Present)

Brief Project Description:

Quantum annealing, a quantum heuristic for approximately solving NP-hard binary optimization problems, is already in commercial use in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. The time-complexity of quantum annealing, however, that is, how the required resources for running the algorithm scale with problem size, is still under investigation.

However, thanks to recent breakthroughs published in Science and Nature, we now know that that the performance of quantum annealing is intimately tied to dissipative dynamics at spin glass bottlenecks, otherwise known as avoided crossings. Dissipative dynamics at avoided crossings contain critical information about the projected performance of quantum annealing for large problem sizes.
