# Redfield
Time-dependent Redfield solver for simulating the D Wave 2X

Calculation of transition rates suggests that incoherent tunneling accelerates at bottlenecks of QAA, thermalizing these bottlenecks in an intermediate-N regime, dominating coherent (quantum) tunneling in the large-N limit, and forming a computational advantage. This Redfield solver spearheads an ongoing search for experimental signatures of this new phenomenon in the D Wave 2X at NASA Ames.
